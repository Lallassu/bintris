- Test to print pixelsPerPoint in resize in studio
    -> could be used for scaling?
- Resize all sprites on resize event.
    -> scale based on set scale.
    -> "full" scaled -> full-scale calc.
- Remove "font" -> in texture add Text(txt string) -> Object
- Object -> collection of sprites that moves the same and same effect.

- Fix click position
- Fix delete object
- Re-use tile rows
- 320x320 -> Remove/Remake projection
- Cleanup shaders (effects in frag shader instead)
